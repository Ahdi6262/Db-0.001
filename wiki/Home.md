# Unified Database API with Infinite Matrix

Welcome to the wiki for the Unified Database API project! This project provides a powerful and flexible API system for interacting with multiple database types through a unified interface, while also offering n-dimensional data storage through the Infinite Matrix implementation.

## What is the Unified Database API?

The Unified Database API is a comprehensive system that allows you to:

- Interact with multiple database types (SQL, NoSQL, Graph, Time-series, Vector) through a single API
- Store and query n-dimensional data with the Infinite Matrix
- Dynamically configure and customize every aspect of the system at runtime
- Easily integrate with applications through a flexible client library

## Key Features

- **Multiple Database Support**: Work with PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Neo4j, InfluxDB, Qdrant, and more through a unified interface
- **Infinite Matrix**: Store data in an n-dimensional space with automatic scaling and efficient storage
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Customize the system behavior at runtime
- **Client Library**: Easy-to-use client library for seamless integration
- **Extensible Architecture**: Add support for new database types through the adapter system

- [Infinite Matrix Guide](Infinite-Matrix)

## Architecture

The system consists of three main components:

1. **Core API Server**: Handles database connections, request routing, and dynamic configuration
2. **Infinite Matrix Engine**: Manages n-dimensional data with automatic scaling
3. **Client Library**: Provides a convenient interface for applications

## Use Cases

The Unified Database API is designed for a wide range of use cases:

- **Multi-Database Applications**: Applications that need to work with different database types
- **Time-Series Analytics**: Analyzing time-series data across multiple dimensions
- **Feature Matrices**: Comparing features across products, versions, and more
- **User Analytics**: Tracking user activity across various dimensions
- **Scientific Computing**: Storing and querying multi-dimensional scientific data
